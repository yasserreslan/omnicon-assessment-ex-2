# Exercise 2: ApiCaller Class Implementation

## Key Points of the Implementation:

### HTTP Client Setup
HttpClient is used to perform the API call. The base URL and bearer token are set appropriately.

### Asynchronous Request
The GET request is made asynchronously to the specified endpoint.

### Error Handling
Exceptions are caught and handled using a try-catch block to manage any issues during the HTTP request.

### Response Processing
The response is processed and returned as a string.
